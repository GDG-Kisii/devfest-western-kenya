### Project Assets:
> Follow the design guide below with the recommended assets. This includes the color codes, fontsize and font family. This enhances the typography of the page:

> Use the Google primary color palette in assets or communications.
White is the most important color in our palette. It provides simplicity and clarity to our visuals, and is the foundation of all Google designs, illustrations, and environments.

### a. Color code
Use the primary colors to create focus. Pair core colors with neutrals and a white background to bring dimension and focus to an illustration.
